      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <h3>What is Checker?</h3>
	  <p>Checker is a software project implementing financial logic designed to
	  help stabilize the value of a cryptographic coin with respect to an
	  externally provided index.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker a token or a coin of some sort? Is it a stablecoin?</h3>
	  <p>No, Checker is a software project. The code base does define two
	  different kinds of tokens and implements financial logic designed to
	  stabilize the value of one of them with respect to an externally
	  provided index or reference.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Didn't there use to be three tokens?</h3>
	  <p>As recently as October 2nd 2019, the design relied on three kinds of tokens but
	  that is no longer the case.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker a protocol amendment for Tezos?</h3>
	  <p>No, Checker's core logic is articulated around a set of
	  smart-contracts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is there a white paper or source code available?</h3>
	  <p>The details are still mostly stealth, but that's primarily
	  because if a lot was out there, I might feel disinclined to change
	  it even if warranted by further reflection.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Who is developing Checker?</h3>
	  <p>Currently, Arthur Breitman is developing Checker.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Does Checker implement an algorithmic stablecoin?</h3>
	  <p>There doesn't seem to be an agreed upon definition on
	  what that means. The closest existing project in terms of design
	  would be MakerDAO.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker like MakerDAO?</h3>
	  <p>There are many similarities, but also important design
	  differences. Notably there is no reliance on a global
	  settlement mechanism and Checker can operate in a regime
	  where the demand for holding the stablecoin exceeds the
	  demand for locking up tez. One early consideration was making
	  the terms under which tez is locked more flexible, but this
	  has taken less prominance in further revisions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>If such a software were deployed, couldn't this create
	  a concentration of baking power?</h3>
	  <p>No. The system is designed such that, when tez is pledged, the baking
	  rights are retained by the party pledging the collateral.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker like Tether</h3>
	  <p>No.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker like Basis?</h3>
	  <p>No.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Broadly speaking, how does it work?</h3>
	  <p>Tokens are stabilized by backing them, on chain, with contracts collateralized by
	  a cryptocurrency and indexed on an external metric provided by a set of oracles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Doesn't using oracles defeat the purpose?</h3>
	  <p>The need to rely on oracles is both unfortunate and unavoidable. It's certainly possible
	  for these oracles to be decentralized to some extent, which adds resiliency to the system, but
	  it by no means rules out the possibility of the oracle acting maliciously. Despite the
	  reliance on oracles, the system does reduce the amount of trust involved.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Are you interested in designing a multi-collateral based system?</h3>
	  <p>Not particularly. If the collateral is a claim on some off-chain assets,
	  then you lose the censorship resistance aspect of an on-chain system.
	  Purely on-chain assets that have any real value and aren't a base layer cryptocurrency
	  are pretty rare.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>How can you get parity without convertibility?</h3>
	  <p>You can't, the stabilization is relative and the stabilized coin may (slowly)
	  drift with respect to the index. MakerDAO's Dai only achieves parity if participants
	  are more interested in creating “CDPs” than in holding Dai for its convenience yield.
	  Otherwise it gets traped into global settlements otherwise because of a zero-bound
	  on the stability fee.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Does the financial logic guarantee the stability of a stablecoin?</h3>
	  <p>No, that's impossible. In such systems there's always some residual risk. That
	  said, this isn't merely trading off volatility for tail risk. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>If there is a risk, there should be a risk discount, so how can there be a peg?</h3>
	  <p>There is also a convenience premium. For some amount of supply, they cancel each other out.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Why is it called Checker</h3>
	  <p>Checkers are simpler than chess, and the system is meant to be
	  simple to understand and analyze. In addition, the name is easy to
	  remember and provides for interesting visual components around
	  checkerboard patterns.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is there a name for the coin that Checker attempts to stabilize?</h3>
	  <p>"Kit", tentatively. Like a baby fox.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>What happened to “draught”</h3>
	  <p>It's been deprecated.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>
	  <p>This is mostly a placeholder until more information about Checker is published.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>When will more information about Checker be available?</h3>
	  <p>I don't know.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Can I buy Checker?</h3>
	  <p>The source code and other intellectual properties associated with
	  Checker are not for sale.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Can I buy the Checker token?</h3>
	  <p>There is no token, so no.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Will there be a token?</h3>
	  <p>I don't know.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Are you raising money?</h3>
	  <p>No.</p>
	</li>
