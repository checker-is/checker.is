      <h1>&#x1f67e; Checker - coin stabilization technology for Tezos.</h1>
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <h3>What is Checker?</h3>
	  <p>Checker is a software project implementing financial logic designed to
	  help stabilize the value of a cryptographic coin with respect to an
	  externally provided index.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker a token or a coin of some sort? Is it a stablecoin?</h3>
	  <p>No, Checker is a software project. The code base does define three
	  different kinds of tokens and implements financial logic designed to
	  stabilize the value of one of them with respect to an externally
	  provided index or reference.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker a protocol amendment for Tezos?</h3>
	  <p>No, Checker's core logic is articulated around a set of
	  smart-contracts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is there a white paper or source code available?</h3>
	  <p>No, the details are still stealth.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Who is developing Checker?</h3>
	  <p>Currently, Arthur Breitman is developing Checker.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Does Checker implement an algorithmic stablecoin?</h3>
	  <p>There doesn't seem to be an agreed upon definition on
	  what that means. The closest existing project in terms of design
	  is MakerDAO.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker like MakerDAO?</h3>
	  <p>There are many similarities, but also important design
	  differences. For instance, there is no reliance on a global
	  settlement mechanism, and the terms under which collateral is
	  pledged are more flexible.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>If such a software were deployed, couldn't this create
	  a concentration of baking power?</h3>
	  <p>No. The system is designed such that, when tez is pledged, the baking
	  rights are retained by the party pledging the collateral.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker like Tether</h3>
	  <p>No.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is Checker like Basis?</h3>
	  <p>No.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Broadly speaking, how does it work?</h3>
	  <p>Tokens are stabilized by backing them, on chain, with contracts collateralized by
	  a cryptocurrency and indexed on an external metric provided by a set of oracles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Are you interested in designing a multi-collateral based system?</h3>
	  <p>Not particularly. If the collateral is a claim on some off-chain assets,
	  then you lose the censorship resistance aspect of an on-chain system.
	  Purely on-chain assets that have any real value and aren't a base layer cryptocurrency
	  are pretty rare.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>How can you get parity without convertibility?</h3>
	  <p>You can't. As a result, a possible failure mode of the system is that the
	  total supply of stabilized coins goes to 0. This is not a particularly dramatic
	  outcome.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Does the financial logic guarantee the stability of a stablecoin?</h3>
	  <p>No, that's impossible. In such systems there's always some residual risk. That
	  said, this isn't merely trading off volatility for tail risk. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>If there is a risk, there should be a risk discount, so how can there be a peg?</h3>
	  <p>There is also a convenience premium. For some amount of supply, they cancel each other out.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Why is it called Checker</h3>
	  <p>Checkers are simpler than chess, and the system is meant to be
	  simple to understand and analyze. In addition, the name is easy to
	  remember and provides for interesting visual components around
	  checkerboard patterns.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Is there a name for the coin that Checker attempts to stabilize?</h3>
	  <p>"Kit", tentatively. Like a baby fox.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>
	  <p>This is mostly a placeholder until more information about Checker is published.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>When will more information about Checker be available?</h3>
	  <p>I don't know.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Can I buy Checker?</h3>
	  <p>The source code and other intellectual properties associated with
	  Checker are not for sale.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Can I buy the Checker token?</h3>
	  <p>There is no token, so no.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Will there be a token?</h3>
	  <p>I don't know.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>Are you raising money?</h3>
	  <p>No.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h3>How can I help?</h3>
	  <p>If you have a strong background in microeconomics,
	  financial risk modelling, stochastic calculus, and
	  optimal control, I'd be happy to run some ideas by you.
	  At this time, I'm not looking for any other type of help.</p>
