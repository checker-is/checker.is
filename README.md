# Checker

## Introduction

This technical document introduces the concept of a “robocoin” and describes a hypothetical system named “checker” to implement one on a Tezos chain.

## Concepts

The following sections define a few concepts which, taken together work to form Checker.

### The clock

Any computation on a blockchain happens in discrete time. We mark the timestamps at which the Checker system is updated as a series of increasing timestamps, $t_i$. Ideally, these updates happen at every block and thus, under the Carthage protocol, those timestamps are separated by about a minute each. That said, the system is designed to be resilient to changes in the interblock time and to missing the occasional updates.

### Target and quantity

In Checker, robocoins called “kit” are algorithmically balanced to achieve a certain degree of steadiness with respect to a *quantity* and an *index* forming a *target*.

The *quantity*, $q_{t_i}$, expressed in $\mathrm{kit}^{-1}$ is a time varying property of the system which can fluctuate upwards or downwards.

The *index*, expressed in $\mathrm{kit}$ is an external measure of value. For instance, the index might be “the median hourly minimum wage across OCDE countries, expressed in kits” or “the value of one CHF, expressed in kits”. This index is provided through a combination of off-chain and on-chain oracles.

The *target*, $p_{t_i}$, is the dimensionless product of the *index* and the *quantity*. For instance the *target* might be “the median of $q_{t_i}$ hours of minimum wage across all OCDE countries as a number of kits” or “the minimal compensation, in kits, that an airline might owe a passenger, pursuant to the vienna convention, should they lose $q_{t_i}$ kg of luggage as a number of kits.” or “how many kits for $q_{t_i}$ Swiss Francs”.

Intuitively, if the target $p_{t_i}$ is below $1$, then kits are, in a sense “too expensive” and if the target is above $1$ then kits are, in a sense, “too cheap”.

### The instantaneous drift

At any point in time, the system defines a dimensionless, time-varying, instantaneous drift, $d_{t}$. The drift is implicitely piecewise-linear between two clock ticks:
$$t_{i} < t < t_{i+1} \Rightarrow d_{t} = \frac{(t_{i+1}-t)d_{t_i} + (t-t_i)d_{t_{i+1}}}{t_{i+1}-t_i}$$.

The drift is applied to the quantity such that $q'(t) = d(t) q(t)$, hence:

$$q_{t_{i+1}} = q_{t_i} \textrm{exp}\left(\frac{d_{t_i}+d_{t_{i+1}}}{2}(t_{i+1}-t_i)\right)$$

The presence of the average between $d_{t_i}$ and $d_{t_{i+1}}$ comes from the piecewise linear model for $d_t$.

### Oracles

A set of $n\_oracle$ oracle feeds $o^{1, t}, \ldots o^{n\_oracle, t}$ provided the **tez** denominated value of the external index (e.g. 1 CHF). The median of these oracles gives the feed $tz_t$.

#### Filters

##### Protected index

The median of external oracles is itself filtered as follow. We first define the protected index, $\widehat{tz}_t$.

$$\widehat{tz}_{t_i} = \widehat{tz}_{t_{i-1}} \times \mathrm{clamp}\!\left(\frac{tz_{t_i}}{\widehat{tz}_{t_{i-1}} }, e^{-\epsilon (t_{i}-t_{i-1})}, e^{\epsilon (t_{i}-t_{i-1})}\right)$$

We suggest a value of $\epsilon = 0.05~\mathrm{cNp/min}$ (about 72 cNp / day which means the filter can catch up to a 2x or 0.5x move in 24 hours and a 3% move in an hour). As designed $\widehat{tz}_t$ will always be lagging behind large moves but it will be insensitive to spikes, real or fabricated.

In addition, we define the following prices

##### Minting index

The feed $tz^{minting}_t = \max (tz_t, \widehat{tz}_t)$ is the maximum of $tz_t$ and $\widehat{tz}_t$.

##### Liquidation index

The feed $tz^{liquidation}_t = \min(tz_t, \widehat{tz}_t)$ is the miminum of $tz_t$ and $\widehat{tz_t}$.

#### Changing oracle feed

Initially the set of feed is fixed. A Tezos protocol upgrade is **strongly recommended** to give bakers the ability to signal in each block support for the addition or removal of oracle feeds.


#### Target

The Checker system includes a uniswap-like contract which gives an indication of the price of kit in tez, $k_t$ with unit $\mathrm{tez}~\mathrm{kit}^{-1}$. The target can be computed as

$$p_t = q_t tz_t / k_t$$


For example suppose $tz_t = 0.36~\textrm{xtz},~ k_t = 0.3~\textrm{xtz/kit},~q_t = 0.9~\mathrm{kit}^{-1}$, then $p_t = 1.08$. Since $p_t > 1$, we can stay that kit is too cheap.

We do not need to filter the target feed as it only affects the drift in a bounded way that is, even if $tz_t$ experiences wild, short lived swing, it will not have a major effect on the system.

## Algorithmic control

Consider the measure of imbalance $$\log p_t = \log(q_t tz_t / k_t)$$

All logarithm values are expressed in cNp or centinepers (for small values, a centineper is almost the same as a percentage point so you can safely read 2 cNp and 2% as roughly the same thing).

We define the rate of change of the drift $d_t$ as $d'_t$. At any point in time $d'_t$ is defined based on the imbalance:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
|\log p_t| < 0.5~\textrm{cNp} & \Rightarrow & d'_t = 0\\
0.5~\textrm{cNp} < |\log p_t| < 5~\textrm{cNp} & \Rightarrow & d'_t = \mathrm{sign}(\log p_t) 0.01~\textrm{cNp}/\textrm{day}^2\\
5~\textrm{cNp} < |\log p_t| & \Rightarrow & d'_t = \mathrm{sign}(\log p_t) 0.05~\textrm{cNp}/\textrm{day}^2\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

It's easy to imagine models where $d'_t$ depends continuously on $\log p_t$ but our intuition is that such models tend to be less robust than simple bang-bang models such as the one above.

Remarks: the unit of $d_t$ is $\textrm{cNp}/\textrm{day}$ because it represents the growth or shrinking of $q_t$ per unit of time. Therefore, it is natural that the unit of $d'_t$ is in  $\textrm{cNp}/\textrm{day}^2$. To get a better intuition of those quantities suppose drift starts at 0 cNp / day and imbalance stays below -0.5 cNp but above -5 cNp for a month, the drift would grow to 0.3 cNp / day, and $q_t$ would increase by 4.65 cNp (about 4.76%). If imbalance stayed below 5 cNp for a month, the drift would go from 0 cNp / day to 1.5 cNp / day in a month, increasing $q_t$ by 23.25 cNp (about 26.18%).

When compared to MakerDAO this is essentially setting a rate of increase or decrease for a (potentially negative!) stability fee programmatically, based on prices, as opposed to votes.

## Burrows

Burrows are similar to CDPs in MakerDAO. Each burrow is an independent smart-contract. **In particular, the creator of the burrow is free to set the delegation address associated with it.** Both tez and kit can be deposited in the burrow and, under the right conditions, the owner can mint kits from the burrow or withdraw tez.

The actions that can be performed on a burrow are

- changing permissions (see OCaml code in appendix for more details)
- mint kit ("burrowing")
- set the delegate
- burn kit (a terrible thing to do a baby fox)
- assign the burrow to some other party
- deposit tez
- whithdraw tez 
- close the burrow
- mark the burrow for liquidation

### Burrowing and overburrowing

Burrowing is the action of minting kits out of a burrow. To avoid overpopulation of kits, the burrowing it limited depending on the number of tez in the burrow. Generally, kits can be minted so long as the tez in the burrow exceeds $f$ times the number of minted kits multiplied by $q_t$ multiplied by $tz^{minting}_t$. We propose $f = 2$.

Assume for instance $tz^{minting}_t = 0.36 \textrm{xtz}$ and $q_t = 1.015$. To mint 10 kits, one would require $2 \times 10 \times 0.36 \times 1.015 = 7.308~\mathrm{xtz}$ in the burrow.

In situations where the number of kits outstanding exceeds $f q_t tz^{liquidation}_t$, the burrow can be marked for liquidation, as we'll see later.

### Burrow fee

While a burrow has outstanding kits, it continuously incurs a burrow fee, assessed in kits, on its outstanding kit balance. The fee is compounded and implicitely added to the outstanding kit balance.

A 0.5 cNp fee per year is assessed and implicitely credited to a tez / kit uniswap contract which is described below in this document. It's important that this is done implicitely, i.e. whenever the uniswap contract it calls, it knows exactly what its balance is.

Note: it might seem at first like the fee is "paid" for by the burrow creators but, from an economic perspective, the view that it is paid for by the kit holders is equally valid as the fee can be offset by an adjustment of the rift adjustments.

### Imbalance adjustment

The imbalace adjustment takes the form of either a fee or a bonus. The exact amount of the fee (or bonus) is set depending on the imbalance between the number of kits in circulation and the outstanding number of kits that would need to be burned to close all burrows.

In general those numbers should be equal but, imperfect liquidations could cause the numbers to become different. If the former is greater than the latter, the fee is increased and the extra kit are burned. If some burrows are left unfilled, this restores the balance.

The fee / bonus is capped at $\pm 5$ cNp per year, is proportional to the imbalance in cNp and saturates when the imbalance hits 20%.

This means that if the system were to end up being undercollateralized, the drift would become lower and dilute the value of the kit, whereas if the system were to end up being overcollateralized the drift would become higher concentrating the value of the kit.

## Liquidation

In situations where the number of kits outstanding exceeds $f q_t tz^{liquidation}_t$, the burrow can be marked for liquidation.

There is a reward for doing so, equal to the greater of 5 kit, or 0.01 cNp of the outstanding kit balance. The kit payed for the reward are minted out of the burrow, even if it means further increasing the burrowing ratio. This is done simply out of convenience.

Note that we rely directly on the target and *not* and any kit / tez price we might observe on-chain. The reason is that, kits being off target should _not_ cause a hardening or loosening of burrowing rules.

Once a burrow is marked for liquidation, one can determine the amount of tez that needs to be sold for kit at the current $tz^{minting}_t$ price in order to return the burrow in a state where any outstanding kits could have just been minted.

That portion of the tez collateral is sent to queue and the burrow is assigned a set of lot numbers. As the queue receives tez to sell for kit, it chops them up in increments of $tez\_batch$. We suggest $tez\_batch = 10,000~\textrm{xtz}$. Each lot is given a lot number which is held by the burrows which contributed the tez to the lot. 

## Lots auction

If there are any lots waiting to be auctionned, Checker starts an open, ascending bid auction. There is a reserve price set at $tz_t$ which declines exponentially over time as long as no bid as been placed. Once a bid is placed, the auction continues. Every bid needs to improve over the previous bid by at least 0.33 cNp and adds the longer of 20 blocks or 20 minutes, to the time before the auction expires.

The average price at which the collateral was sold tells us if the liquidation was warranted or not. If it was (i.e. the burrow was undercollateralized) 20% of any excess tez in the contract is forfeited to the uniswap contract (i.e. is added to its liquidity).

## Uniswap

There is a uniswap contract attached to the checker contract. It is much like a standard uniswap contract (including the ability to mint and redeem tokens representing a contribution of liquidity to the contract) except that its balance in kit increases over time as kits are minted out of burrows to pay for part of the burrowing fee and tez are sometimes forefeited to it. This balance is adjusted anytime the checker contract is called, looking back at the last time the contract was called and calculating the fee incurred in between.

The contract's implied xtz/kit price is used as part of the oracle.

The right to bake for this contract is automatically auctionned off to the best bidder, the proceeds of the auction only accrue to the pool with a delay of 1 cycle.

## Governance

Checker attempts to minimize governance. It may be necessary however to remove a bad oracle feed or to tweak the parameters used in the system. We suggest a protocol amendment where bakers signal in block their desire to remove or add oracle feeds.


## Notes

- Checker is an FA2 contract with liquidity tokens and kit.
- Ideally it also supports utxo tickets for both of those things

## Actions

We use a monolithic contract with the following functionality

### Monolithic contract
- Touch contract to update drift
- Touch contract to update oracle values
- Transfer kit
- Burrow
  - Create
  - Issue kit upon request of a burrow
- Uniswap
  - Purchase kit
  - Purchase tez
  - Create liquidity share
  - Redeem liquidity share
  - Transfer liquidity share
(see OCaml code for a more rigorous interface definition)

  
### Burrow contract
- Set permissions 
- Deposit / withdraw tez
- Set delegate
- Mint / burn kit
- Mark as being in liquidation
- Purchase collateral from a burrow ongoing liquidation
(see OCaml code for a more rigorous interface definition)
  
  
Lambdas are wrapped in bigmaps and loaded lazily to lower gas costs.


## Appendix : the auction queue.

The auction queue is based on an AVL tree. The nodes of the tree contain collateral for liquidation, represented as a pair between a balance and a burrow and the time at which they entered the queue. Every node also maintains the total amount of liquidation  in its right child and in its left child.

When a new auction begins, the tree is cut into two trees, the first one containing the earliest liquidation items summing up to exactly an amount of exactly 10,000 tez, and the other one the  rest of it. This might entail cutting a liquidation item in half  and doing a bit of tree surgery (the first one is, in general, composed of two subtrees of the initial tree) but it remains in O(log n).

The 10,000 are auctionned and the root of the tree of the items that were part of this batch auction is stored in a map indexed by this auction's batch number.

When contracts undergoing liquidation want to recuperate some of the funds that they recouped through the auction, they indicate the path in the tree to their bid and receive the corresponding amount.

This design has the property that amounts queued for liquidation can be cancelled.


## Roadmap

1. Clean up and formalize this paper
2. Implement checker as a system in OCaml (mocking up the interaction with the chain)
3. Modify the OCaml implementation to ensure that all "heavy" storage is persisted to bigmaps
4. Flatten the Ocaml implementation to get rid of modules (replace with underscores for namespacing)
5. Convert the code to MLigo

Alternative: do not use Ligo, use meta-michelson in OCaml.

       the current price estimate.

  val touch : t -> t

  (* A few thoughts. What does it mean to be liquidated? It means that a portion of the funds is going to be
     sent to a liquidation queue in the checker contract. That liquidation queue auctions out blocks of, say,
     10,000 tez for kits (or some price defined amount).

     When the tez is taken from the contract and placed in the queue, the amount and "bins" your collateral
     is placed in is recorded. When the sell happens, a claim can be made for the kits burned to be 
     deducted from this contract debt at the pro-rata. 

     If the contract has recovered and should not be in liquidation anymore, cancel the earliest bid
     in the auction queue and get some tez back. This can be called repeatedly until it's all 
     cancelled.
